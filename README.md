# Xcode Usage
To ensure the code can have access to the test file you should do the following 
  * Run the code once; it will say it can't find the file
  * Right click on the executable file and click "Show in Finder"
  * Copy and Paste the "Text_Cases.txt"
  
# Extra
I designed the code to handle custom functions such as nCr, bitwise logic, factorial, etc. The instructions for creating your own custom function can be found on the header of the Class.
